# Introduction

Welcome to this second command-line class! 

If you didn't follow Command-line 101 and need to grasp the basics of command-line and Linux click [here](../command_line_101).

In this class, we'll go further down the rabbit hole and learn how to use more advanced command and chain multiple commands together.

This class is supposed to be followed with [hack.courses](https://hack.courses) open alongside, the challenges are made to be completed in the website's interactive terminal.
