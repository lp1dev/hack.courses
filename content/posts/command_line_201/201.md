# Introduction

Welcome to this second command-line class! 

If you didn't follow Command-line 101 and need to grasp the basics of command-line and Linux click [here](../command_line_101).

In this class, we'll go further down the rabbit hole and learn how to use more advanced command and chain multiple commands together.

This class is supposed to be followed with [hack.courses](https://hack.courses) open alongside, the challenges are made to be completed in the website's interactive terminal.

# Input/Output and redirections

## Linux filesystem

Let's start this course by talking about the way inputs and outputs are handled on Linux systems!

Inputs and outputs are quintessentials for operating systems and such important features are usually handled by the *most important* and basic part of it : the **kernel**.

> **Definition** : A **kernel** is basically what you have left when you remove every executable and configuration file on your system, it's the part which handles your filesystems, users, groups, permissions and essential hardware.

Each kernel follows its own paradigms, regarding Linux, there is a famous saying in IT and Computer Science :

> "In Linux, everything is a file"

Which might sound odd as a concept. It actually means that the way the Linux kernel handles most things is by creating or allowing you to create entries for them in the filesystem.

For instance, if you plug in a new webcam into your GNU/Linux machine, a new file will be created in the */dev/* directory for it. Those files are named *special files*. 

If you want to access a process's environment variables, you can read the contents of the */proc/self/environ* file.

## Standard inputs and output

We will now describe some of the more oftenly used special files, those are the ones your shell uses in order to read user inputs and display errors and processes outputs.

### /dev/stdin

Also known as the **standard input** (stdin)

### /dev/stdout

Also known as the **standard output** (stdout)

### /dev/stderr

### Other special files

- /dev/null
- /dev/random
