# Data and file manipulation (head, tail, wc, grep, find)

Oh, there you are! I was waiting for you to come back from [202](./202)!

Now that you're here we're going to talk about new Linux **commands** you might not know about yet, these commands allow the modification of files and data streams.

> **Note** : We are not going to discuss file creation or deletion in this class for technical reasons regarding the terminal on hack.courses, but it might be part of another future class ;).

---

## head

Let's start with the command `head`, it seems appropriate to start with this specific one since it displays the start of a given file or data stream.
By default, head will **only display the 10 first lines** of the contents passed to it as parameters.

You can try it using the following command :

```bash
$> head /etc/passwd
```

```bash
root:x:0:0:root:/root:/usr/bin/shell.sh
bin:x:1:1:bin:/bin:/sbin/nologin
daemon:x:2:2:daemon:/sbin:/sbin/nologin
adm:x:3:4:adm:/var/adm:/sbin/nologin
lp:x:4:7:lp:/var/spool/lpd:/sbin/nologin
sync:x:5:0:sync:/sbin:/bin/sync
shutdown:x:6:0:shutdown:/sbin:/sbin/shutdown
halt:x:7:0:halt:/sbin:/sbin/halt
mail:x:8:12:mail:/var/mail:/sbin/nologin
news:x:9:13:news:/usr/lib/news:/sbin/nologin
```

As you can see, only the 10 first lines of the `/etc/passwd` are displayed, you can also specify the number of lines you want to print using the `-n` parameter, for instance if you only want the first two lines of the same file :

```bash
$> head -n 2 /etc/passwd
```


## tail

## wc

## grep


## find

Wow, you're there early aren't you?

I'm still working on this part, it will be available soon, come back later!
