## Linux Scripts Execution and Writing

Welcome to Command Line 205! By now, you've gotten comfortable with basic commands and some intermediate utilities. It's time to step up your game by learning how to write and execute Linux scripts. This course will guide you through the fundamentals of creating scripts, making them executable, and running them efficiently.

### What is a Script?

A script is a file containing a series of commands that the shell can execute. Think of it as a way to automate repetitive tasks, making your work on the command line more efficient. Scripts are typically written in **Bash**—the default shell for most Linux distributions—but they can be written in other languages too, like Python, Ruby, lua, PowerShell or Perl.

### Using Nano for Script Writing

Before diving deeper into scripting, let’s take a moment to get familiar with `nano`, a simple yet powerful text editor available in most Linux distributions. `nano` is user-friendly and ideal for beginners, especially when writing scripts or editing configuration files.

#### Opening a File with Nano

To start editing a file with `nano`, simply type:

```bash
$> nano filename.sh
```

If the file doesn’t exist, `nano` will create it for you. In this case, we’ll continue with our previous script:

```bash
$> nano my_first_script.sh
```

#### Navigating in Nano

When you open a file with `nano`, you’ll see your text in the main part of the screen, with a helpful menu of commands at the bottom. Here’s how you can navigate and perform basic tasks:

- **Moving the Cursor:** Use the arrow keys to move the cursor around the text.
- **Page Up/Down:** Use `Ctrl + Y` (Page Up) and `Ctrl + V` (Page Down) to scroll through the file quickly.
- **Jumping to a Line:** Press `Ctrl + _`, type the line number, and press Enter to jump to a specific line.

#### Basic Editing Commands

Let’s look at some basic editing commands that you’ll often use in `nano`:

- **Saving Your Work:** Once you’ve written your script, save it by pressing `Ctrl + O` (Write Out). Nano will ask for the filename, which should already be filled in. Press Enter to confirm.
- **Exiting Nano:** To exit `nano`, press `Ctrl + X`. If you haven’t saved your changes, nano will prompt you to save before exiting.
- **Cutting Text:** To cut a line of text, move the cursor to that line and press `Ctrl + K`. This cuts the line and stores it in a buffer.
- **Pasting Text:** To paste the line you cut, move the cursor to the desired location and press `Ctrl + U`.
- **Undo and Redo:** If you make a mistake, you can undo it by pressing `Ctrl + _` and then `U` for undo. Unfortunately, nano doesn’t have a simple redo feature.

#### Searching and Replacing Text

Searching for text in a file is straightforward:

- **Searching:** Press `Ctrl + W`, then type the text you’re looking for and press Enter. Nano will jump to the first occurrence of that text.
- **Finding the Next Match:** To find the next occurrence, press `Ctrl + W` again and then Enter.
- **Replacing Text:** To replace text, press `Ctrl + \\`. Enter the text you want to find, press Enter, and then enter the replacement text.

#### Creating a Script with Nano

Let’s use `nano` to write a simple script:

1. Open a new file with nano:

   ```bash
   $> nano my_script.sh
   ```

2. Type the following script:

   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   echo "This is a test script."
   ```

3. Save your script by pressing `Ctrl + O` and then Enter.

4. Exit nano by pressing `Ctrl + X`.

Your script is now saved, and you can proceed to make it executable as discussed earlier with the `chmod` command.

### Writing Your First Script

Let's start with a simple script. Open your favorite text editor (like `nano` or `vim`) and create a new file:

```bash
$> nano my_first_script.sh
```

In this file, type the following lines:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# My first script

echo "Hello, world!"
```

This is a basic Bash script. Here’s a breakdown of what each line does:

- `#!/bin/bash`: This is called a shebang. It tells the system that this script should be run using the Bash shell.
- `# My first script`: This is a comment. Anything following a `#` in a script is ignored by the shell. Use comments to describe what your script does or to leave notes for yourself or others.
- `echo "Hello, world!"`: The `echo` command prints the text `"Hello, world!"` to the terminal.

### Making the Script Executable

Before you can run your script, you need to make it executable. Use the `chmod` command to change the file permissions:

```bash
$> chmod +x my_first_script.sh
```

This command gives the script executable permissions. Now you can run it like any other command:

```bash
$> ./my_first_script.sh
```

Output:
```bash
Hello, world!
```

Congratulations! You’ve just written and executed your first Linux script.

### Adding Logic to Your Script

Scripts can do much more than just print text. You can add logic, such as conditional statements and loops, to make your scripts more powerful.

#### Conditional Statements

Let's extend our script to include a simple `if` statement. Open the `my_first_script.sh` file and add the following:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Script with conditional logic

if [ "$1" == "world" ]; then
  echo "Hello, world!"
else
  echo "Hello, $1!"
fi
```

Here’s what’s happening:

- `if [ "$1" == "world" ]; then`: This checks if the first argument passed to the script (`$1`) is equal to `"world"`. If it is, the script prints "Hello, world!".
- `else`: If the condition isn’t met, the script will execute the code in the `else` block.
- `fi`: This closes the `if` statement.

Now, run the script with an argument:

```bash
$> ./my_first_script.sh world
```

Output:
```bash
Hello, world!
```

And with a different argument:

```bash
$> ./my_first_script.sh Linux
```

Output:
```bash
Hello, Linux!
```

#### Loops

Loops are another powerful feature of scripting. They allow you to execute a block of code multiple times. Here’s an example of a `for` loop:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Script with a loop

for i in 1 2 3 4 5; do
  echo "This is loop iteration $i"
done
```

When you run this script:

```bash
$> ./my_first_script.sh
```

Output:
```bash
This is loop iteration 1
This is loop iteration 2
This is loop iteration 3
This is loop iteration 4
This is loop iteration 5
```

### Passing Arguments to Scripts

You’ve already seen `$1`, which is how you access the first argument passed to a script. Scripts can accept multiple arguments, which are referred to as `$1`, `$2`, `$3`, and so on.

Here’s a script that sums two numbers provided as arguments:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Script to sum two numbers

if [ $# -lt 2 ]; then
  echo "Usage: $0 num1 num2"
  exit 1
fi

num1=$1
num2=$2
sum=$((num1 + num2))

echo "The sum of $num1 and $num2 is $sum"
```

- `if [ $# -lt 2 ]; then`: This checks if fewer than two arguments are provided. `$#` holds the number of arguments passed.
- `num1=$1`: This assigns the first argument to `num1`.
- `sum=$((num1 + num2))`: This performs arithmetic by summing `num1` and `num2`.

Run the script:

```bash
$> ./my_first_script.sh 3 7
```

Output:
```bash
The sum of 3 and 7 is 10
```

### Automating Tasks with Cron

You can automate your scripts to run at specific times using `cron`. Cron jobs are scheduled tasks that run in the background at regular intervals. 

To edit the cron jobs for your user, run:

```bash
$> crontab -e
```

Add a line like this to run your script every day at 2:30 PM:

```bash
30 14 * * * /path/to/my_first_script.sh
```

This will execute `my_first_script.sh` at the specified time every day.

### Summary

You’ve learned the basics of writing and executing Linux scripts, adding logic with conditionals and loops, passing arguments, and even scheduling scripts with cron. Scripts are powerful tools that can automate tasks, making your work on Linux more efficient and enjoyable.

Feel free to experiment with more complex scripts and explore the endless possibilities that scripting on Linux offers!
