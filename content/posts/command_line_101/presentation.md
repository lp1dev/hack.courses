# Command-line 101

This course is a fully interactive and comprehensive class about Linux command-line for beginners.

Do you want to know how to navigate through a filesystem and run programs on Linux using command-line like a pro (Disclaimer: well, an informed beginner at least)? 
Hop in and grab your best keyboard ðŸ˜Ž!

You won't need to install *anything* on your computer (for real), absolutely no prerequisites except from curiosity.
