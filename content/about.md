# What is this terminal?

The terminal on [hack.courses](hack.courses) is a full-fledged GNU/Linux terminal. 

It is based on [xterm.js](https://xtermjs.org/) and gives access to a real Linux command line interpreter to anyone for free.

If you want to start learning the command line, linux, scripting or programming it is a great way to experiment and learn in real-life conditions without having to install anything on your computer.

If you're new to this, check out the [command line 101 class](/cli101) and learn how to use command line right away!
