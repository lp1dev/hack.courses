      <description>Data and file manipulation (head, tail, wc, grep, find) Oh, there you are! I was waiting for you to come back from 202!
Now that you&amp;rsquo;re here we&amp;rsquo;re going to talk about new Linux commands you might not know about yet, these commands allow the modification of files and data streams.
 Note : We are not going to discuss file creation or deletion in this class for technical reasons regarding the terminal on hack.</description>
